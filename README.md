## What am I aiming to create?

I just want to create something that people enjoy using. The feeling of having customers give feedback on your product and telling you that what you created is exactly what they’ve always needed is amazing. I seek that — that feeling fulfills my heart.

## Which languages do I know?

I’m not the type of guy who only knows how to code in JS/TS or the latest useless Javascript Framework. I’m the type of guy who solves problems, regardless of the language or framework.
